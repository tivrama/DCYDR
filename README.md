## Usage

A group is trying to decide whether or not to a do a particular thing (watch a particular movie, go out to dinner, etc.)

One person in the group goes to our site and sees View 1: Voting setup. They can incremenet or decrement the number of voters (the size of the group) at the top, then press the button to start the voting session.

The organizer is now see View 2: Voting session. Anyone who goes to the site at this time for the first time will also see View 2. Anyone who comes in can press the Yes or the No button once. Once it's pressed, the selected option will stay selected and the other option will be greyed out as indication of what they voted for. If at any time the cancel button is pressed by anyone, that voting session will be reset and anyone visiting the site will see View 1.

Once the vote count has reached the original number of voters set up by the organizer, everyone will see View 3 displaying the results. In order to reset for a new voting session they would need to press the cancel button, the same as before.

NOTE ON MVP: Anyone who visits our site will see the current group's session.  Therefore in our first iteration only one group can be using the site at a time.
